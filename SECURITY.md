# Portfolio Website Security Guide

## Security Measures Implemented

This portfolio website has been secured with multiple layers of protection:

### Client-Side Security

- **Content Security Policy (CSP)**: Restricts which resources can be loaded, preventing XSS attacks
- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) Protection**: Input sanitization and output encoding
- **Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) Protection**: Token-based validation for all forms
- **Clickjacking Protection**: X-Frame-Options headers prevent embedding in iframes
- **Referrer Policy**: Controls information sent in the Referrer header
- **External Link Protection**: All external links use rel="noopener noreferrer"
- **Form Validation**: Enhanced client-side validation with anti-bot measures

### Server-Side Security

- **HTTPS Enforcement**: All HTTP requests are redirected to HTTPS
- **HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS)**: Forces secure connections
- **Security Headers**: Comprehensive set of security headers implemented
- **Directory Browsing Prevention**: Blocks access to directory listings
- **Sensitive File Protection**: Blocks access to configuration and system files
- **MIME Type Protection**: Prevents MIME-sniffing attacks

### Additional Security Features

- **robots.txt**: Controls web crawler access
- **security.txt**: Provides security contact information (RFC 9116)
- **Server Configuration**: Both Apache (.htaccess) and IIS (web.config) configurations

## Maintaining Security

### Regular Updates

1. Keep all third-party libraries updated (EmailJS, RemixIcon, etc.)
2. Regularly review and update security headers as standards evolve
3. Periodically rotate CSRF tokens and other security keys

### Security Best Practices

1. **API Keys**: Never expose API keys in client-side code (current EmailJS key should be moved to server-side)
2. **Input Validation**: Always validate user input on both client and server sides
3. **Error Handling**: Avoid exposing detailed error messages to users
4. **Regular Testing**: Periodically test for vulnerabilities

### Reporting Security Issues

## Disclaimer

While these measures significantly improve security, no system can be 100% secure. Regular security audits and updates are recommended.
